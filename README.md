# BMTC-Visualisation
Using the BMTC API to visualise live bus routes on an LED board

## About this repository

This repository will be used to track all the scripts, instructions, and my overall process to create an LED board to visualise live BMTC bus routes.

I'm using the publicly accessible BMTC API, that I am currently in the process of reverse-engineering and documenting. You can check that out at [this](https://github.com/PratyushBalaji/BMTC-API) GitHub repository.
